# Connect Four
A space-themed connect four game. I built this at Spiced Academy during week 3 of the 12-week course on Javascript-focused web development. Check out the rest of my web-development portfolio [here](https://github.com/aleesteele/portfolio).

## Technologies
- Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Description
This was the first full project we built at Spiced Academy using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I really enjoyed styling this project, learning about CSS transitions.

## Preview
Users have the option to play as either the "moon" or "jupiter". The rest is pretty intuitive-- you try to make a row (either horizontal or vertical) of your chosen type.
